# WebRTC

WebRTC enables real-time communication between web browsers and mobile applications.

## Features

- Audio and video communication
- Data channel for sending arbitrary data
- Screen sharing and file sharing
- Peer-to-peer and multiparty communication
- Secure and encrypted communication

## Setup

1. HTML and JavaScript: Include the necessary JavaScript code to interact with the WebRTC APIs.

2. Signaling: Implement a signaling mechanism using WebSocket or a cloud service like Firebase.

3. Media Stream: Capture audio and video streams using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`.

4. Peer Connection: Create an `RTCPeerConnection` object to manage the peer-to-peer connection.

5. ICE Candidates: Exchange ICE candidates between peers for network connectivity.

6. Session Description: Exchange session descriptions (`RTCSessionDescription`) between peers.

7. Handling Events: Implement event handlers for negotiation, connection state changes, and data channel communication.

8. Secure Connections: Use HTTPS for secure and reliable WebRTC communication.

For detailed implementation and code examples, refer to the WebRTC documentation and sample projects.
